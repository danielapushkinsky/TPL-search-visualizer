# Toronto Public Library Search Visualizer

Inspired by Google's [Search Trend Visualizer](https://trends.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize) I decided to create something similar for the TPL (Toronto Public Library).

There is an example of this code running on GitHub Pages: https://danielapushkinsky.github.io/TPL-search-visualizer/

## Information on the Data Used

Information about the [Realtime Feed of Searches Conducted on torontopubliclibrary.ca can be found here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/realtime-feed-of-searches-conducted-on-torontopubliclibrary-ca/).
