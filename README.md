# Toronto Public Library Search Trend Visualizer

Inspired by Google's [Search Trend Visualizer](https://trends.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize) I decided to create something similar for the TPL (Toronto Public Library).

## Information on the Data Used

Information about the [Realtime Feed of Searches Conducted on torontopubliclibrary.ca can be found here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/realtime-feed-of-searches-conducted-on-torontopubliclibrary-ca/).

You can also find an example of the Toronto Public Library using this [here](https://dashboard.tpllabs.ca/)
